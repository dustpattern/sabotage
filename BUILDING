`make` builds everything:

- `sabotage`. A script that injects failures into `.c` files.

- `sabotage-conf`. A utility for building.

- `libsabotage.a`. Generates failures.

- `sample`. A test program.

`make` recursively invokes `Makefile.sample`, which builds the `sample` test
program. Please take a look at `Makefile.sample` for suggestions on how to
integrate `sabotage` into your build process.

`sabotage` will run just fine from the location where it is built. Invoke
`sabotage-conf --cflags` and `sabotage-conf --libs` to get the appropriate
`CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` options. It is also possible to install the tool into a
specific location, for instance:

    make install PREFIX=/usr/local
